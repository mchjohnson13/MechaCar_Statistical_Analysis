# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
* The variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the MPG included vehicle length and ground clearance.
* The slope of these variables are not zero.
* With a multiple R-squared=0.715, it seems to predict the mpg of the MechaCar prototypes effectively, but will likely not predict any new data added to the dataset.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
* Lots 1 and 2 both pass the design specificaitons with variance  of 0.980 and 7.469 respectively.
* Lot 3 does not fall within the design specifications with a variance of 170.286.\
